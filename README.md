Python Graphics in Three Dimensions: Readme
============================================

These Python programs are for people who wish to create art, simulations and games. It may also provide engineers and scientists with some debugged code that they can use for constructing simulations and models without the need to spend weeks or months mastering programming.  

The programs aim to get users quickly to the position where they can start crafting code that lets them make 3-dimensional animated images. 
The driving idea is that a young person with nothing more than a computer can become a creator of games. The code is fundamentally about the geometry used in controlling the virtual worlds of computer games. 
The code is used in the book "Python Graphics for Games: Working in 3 Dimensions" by Mike Ohlson de Fine. In addition to all the code in the book many additional programs are included.

The code is divided into the following topics.
1. Matrix Manipulation in 2-Dimensions: How to transform two-dimensional drawings by stretching them, rotating them and shifting them using matrix algebra programmed in Python.
From chapter 3 of "Python Graphics for Games: Working in 3 Dimensions"

2. Matrix Manipulation in 3-Dimensions: How to transform three-dimensional drawings using Python. From chapter 4 of "Python Graphics for Games: Working in 3 Dimensions"

3. Perspective Projections: How perspective drawings can be controlled using a special Python matrix. From chapter 5 of "Python Graphics for Games: Working in 3 Dimensions"

4. Object creation using SVG and Inkscape: How to produce 2D and 3D drawings using Scaled Vector Graphics from Inkscape and converting the exported SVG files into Python code using Python code. From chapter 6 of "Python Graphics for Games: Working in 3 Dimensions"

5. Object creation using Blender: How to produce 3D or 2D graphic objects using the Open Source Blender software package using Python. From chapter 7 of "Python Graphics for Games: Working in 3 Dimensions"

6. Drawing OpenGL graphic primitives using Python: The basic techniques for drawing OpenGL primitives and GLUT wireshapes using Python. From chapter 8 of "Python Graphics for Games: Working in 3 Dimensions"

7. Animation: Methods of using the OpenGL graphics standard together with Python to produce drawings and animations using Python. From chapter 9 of "Python Graphics for Games: Working in 3 Dimensions"

8. Vertex Arrays and Normals:  OpenGL vertex array instructions using Python. The importance and use of normal vectors is explained as well as a method of making normal vectors visible. From chapter 10 of "Python Graphics for Games: Working in 3 Dimensions"

9. Model Construction: Methods of using OpenGL to assemble virtual world models from a collection of 3D objects using Python. From chapter 11 of "Python Graphics for Games: Working in 3 Dimensions"

10. OpenGL texture mapping: How to use Python to fit intricate images onto OpenGL objects. From chapter 12 of "Python Graphics for Games: Working in 3 Dimensions"

11. OpenGL Fog and Transparency: How to create and control fog and transparency using Python.
From chapter 13 of "Python Graphics for Games: Working in 3 Dimensions"

12. OpenGL Lighting controlled using Python: The basic properties of light sources are demonstrated. Attributes like light position, diffuse, ambient, emissive and specular light are shown. Spotlights are given attention by means of an extended set of examples. 
From chapter 14 of "Python Graphics for Games: Working in 3 Dimensions"
